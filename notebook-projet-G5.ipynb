    "Since the 1990s, the international community has become increasingly aware of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, was initially insufficient to slow global warming. However, ambitious commitments have been made, such as reducing emissions by a factor of 4 by 2050. As the public authorities cannot force individuals to change their habits, action is focusing on behavioural changes. The French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) has launched a call for expressions of interest to promote demonstrators and trials of new mobility solutions in different areas. The Ucac-Icam structure has conducted studies on intelligent multimodal mobility, which presents challenges in terms of resource management and transport logistics."

    "The Greedy Algorithm is a simple approach that makes locally optimal choices at each step to find an overall optimal solution. It starts with an empty solution and incrementally adds elements that offer the most immediate benefit. The Greedy Algorithm does not guarantee finding the globally optimal solution but often produces satisfactory results in less complex problems.\n",

    "The Genetic Algorithm is inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. It emulates the principles of genetics, including mutation, crossover, and selection, to search for the optimal solution in a population of potential solutions. The algorithm iteratively evolves a population of individuals, selecting the fittest individuals for reproduction and applying genetic operators to create new offspring. Over generations, the population converges towards an optimal solution.\n",

    "Particle Swarm Optimization is a computational method inspired by the behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. In PSO, a population of particles moves through the search space, searching for the optimal solution. Each particle adjusts its position based on its own experience and the best position found by any particle in the swarm. Through iterations, particles converge towards the global optimum by exchanging information about their best known positions.\n",

    "These algorithms can be applied to various optimization problems such as scheduling, resource allocation, route planning, and parameter tuning, among others. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which algorithm to use depends on the specific problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while these algorithms can provide good solutions, they may not always guarantee finding the absolute optimal solution due to the complexity and nature of some problems. Therefore, it's essential to consider the problem constraints, problem size, and available computational resources when selecting and applying these optimization algorithms.\n",
