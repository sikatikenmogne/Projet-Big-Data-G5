    "Since the 1990s, the international community has become increasingly aware of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, was initially insufficient to slow global warming. However, ambitious commitments have been made, such as reducing emissions by a factor of 4 by 2050. As the public authorities cannot force individuals to change their habits, action is focusing on behavioural changes. The French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) has launched a call for expressions of interest to promote demonstrators and trials of new mobility solutions in different areas. The Ucac-Icam structure has conducted studies on intelligent multimodal mobility, which presents challenges in terms of resource management and transport logistics."
